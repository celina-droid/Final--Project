A machine learning project using crash-reporting data from Montgomery county in Maryland to forecast the frequency of accidents.Data was taken from Dataworld.com,cleaned using pandas. A model was then produced and the data splitted into testing and training data. The data was fitted in the model and it was about 79% accurate to predict an accident.
