# Final-Project
 
This is my final project

A machine learning project using crash-reporting data from Montgomery county in Maryland to forecast the frequency of accidents.Data was taken from Dataworld.com,cleaned using pandas. A model was then produced and the data splitted into testing and training data. The data was fitted in the model and it was about 79% accurate to predict an accident. Some aspects of the data were visualized using tableau.We visualized the type of vehicles that involved in accidents the most and the direction in which most clashes occured.Interestingly, we found that accident happened between cars moving in the same direction,like cars hitting others from the rear. We also visualized the time of the day that most accidents occured.All these findings can be seen the project presentation.
