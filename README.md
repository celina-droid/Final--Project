# Final-Project
 
This is my final project

A machine learning project using crash-reporting data from Montgomery county in Maryland to forecast the frequency of accidents.Data was taken from Dataworld.com,cleaned using pandas. A model was then produced and the data splitted into testing and training data. The data was fitted in the model and it was about 79% accurate to predict an accident. Some aspects of the data were visualize using tableau.WE visualized the type of vehicles that involved in accidents the most and the direction in which most clashes occured.
